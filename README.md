# webCrawler
A simple web crawler for indeed.ca to quickly list all job ad info. It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML.

The program takes as input: Any number of cities, any number of search terms, a province, and the max age of the ad (in days).

The program prints out all of the jobs that have not been seen before by the program. It saves all of the jobs to a JSON file.
